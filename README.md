# Carbon-Ptero
Pterodactyl egg for Rust with Carbon Mod

Working But Under Development

Upload egg-rust-carbon.json to your Pterodactyl Rust nest.
Create your server, Set your variables and click install to watch the magic happen.

Everything else in the folder can stay where it is and doesnt need to be downloaded/touched.... they are only there for the docker creation
